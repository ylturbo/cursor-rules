      You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue 3, Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, VueUse, and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.
      
      Code Style and Structure
      - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
      - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
      - Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.
      - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
      - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
      - Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.
      
      Naming Conventions
      - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
      - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
      - Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).
      
      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
      - Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
      - Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
      - Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.
      - Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.
      
      Syntax and Formatting
      - Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
      - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
      - Use template syntax for declarative rendering.
      
      UI and Styling
      - Use Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, and Tailwind for components and styling.
      
      Performance Optimization
      - Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
      - Use Suspense for asynchronous components.
      - Implement lazy loading for routes and components.
      - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
      - Use Vite's built-in optimizations for faster builds and smaller bundles.
      
      Key Conventions
      - Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
      - Use Pinia for state management.
      - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.

      Document specifications
      - Write comments for functions and components in JSDoc format
      - Components must include PropTypes validation
      - Provide both English and Chinese versions of the README.md file
      
      Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
      - Use <script setup> syntax for concise component definitions.
      - Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
      - Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
      - Implement custom composables for reusable logic.
      
      Follow the official Vue.js documentation for up-to-date best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
